  <h2>Historical Context – Windrush Children and ESN Schools</h2>

   <p>In the decades following the arrival of the Windrush generation, the British education system systematically misclassified many Black Caribbean children as "educationally subnormal" (ESN), a misjudgment rooted in racialised assumptions masked by a veneer of scientific credibility. Bernard Coard’s 1971 pamphlet, <em>How the West Indian Child Is Made Educationally Sub-Normal in the British School System</em>, exposed the cultural bias embedded in supposedly objective IQ tests that failed to recognise the linguistic and cultural background of Caribbean children. He argued that "the British education system is systematically damaging" to these students, as educational assessments were built around white, middle-class norms that inherently excluded and disadvantaged others. This misplacement into ESN schools perpetuated a cycle of academic underachievement, low self-esteem, and social exclusion.</p>

<p>Colin Brock (1984) reinforces Coard’s argument by highlighting the deeply entrenched cultural and historical factors that shaped the educational disadvantage faced by West Indian students. Brock links this to the legacy of slavery and colonialism, noting that West Indians arrived with a “cultural insecurity” rooted in centuries of imposed inferiority and fractured identity. He stresses that many migrant children came from rural parts of the Caribbean, with limited or rote-based primary education and little exposure to urban life, let alone British schooling systems undergoing their pedagogical upheavals in the 1950s and 1960s. As Brock explains, the result was a severe “culture shock,” worsened by the failure of British educators to adapt teaching or assessment to these children’s backgrounds.</p>

<p>William B. Thomas (1980) reinforces Coard’s core argument by documenting how British schools failed to adapt to the needs of West Indian youth, despite earlier successful reforms made for European immigrants during and after WWII. According to Thomas, the post-1960 response to West Indian immigration was not educational inclusion, but neglect. No national reforms were made to accommodate the rising number of Black pupils. Instead, local education authorities resorted to reactive measures like capping "immigrant" school populations at 30% or using de facto segregation through school zoning and resource cuts. He highlights how many children were placed in ESN schools based on language misunderstandings, unfamiliarity with British norms, or simply because schools sought to “remove” perceived behavioural problems. Thomas cites the 1969 ILEA report, which noted that West Indian children were four times more likely to be placed in ESN schools compared to white British children—a staggering indicator of systemic misclassification.</p>

<p>Thomas also addresses the lack of teacher training, cultural sensitivity, and guidance infrastructure that exacerbated Black children's difficulties. Teachers, he writes, tended to interpret linguistic or behavioural differences as deficiencies, failing to recognise that many West Indian pupils were navigating a "culture shock" in a system rigidly defined by white, middle-class norms. He explains how the British school system viewed itself as a site of social control rather than inclusion, where pupils were trained to “fit into” their assigned social roles. In this view, ESN schools acted as holding grounds that prepared children not for social mobility but for marginalised labour.</p>

<p>Sociologist Sally Tomlinson (2005) further contextualises this structural failure by arguing that post-war education policy was shaped by race-based fears of "uneducable" immigrants, leading to institutional decisions that cemented rather than addressed inequality. John Rex (1986) similarly observed that racism in Britain was institutional, not merely interpersonal, and that education served to maintain rather than challenge social hierarchies. These perspectives reinforce Coard’s warning that misclassification and streaming were not isolated mistakes but part of a larger system that protected privilege under the guise of meritocracy.</p>

<p>The use of culturally biased IQ tests, lack of linguistic support for Creole or patois speakers  , and assumptions of cultural deficiency combined to produce an educational system unfit for inclusion. ESN placements, far from offering support, stigmatised Black children and diverted them from mainstream opportunities. While Coard’s critique was a pivotal intervention, it was largely dismissed by the educational establishment. Yet, as Brock’s work shows, the underlying structures that produced these outcomes were not aberrations but systemic. The parallels between the educational experiences of Black children in the 1970s and those documented decades later suggest a continuity of structural inequality rooted in Britain's colonial and racial history.</p>
