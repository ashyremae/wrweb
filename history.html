    <p>The arrival of the Windrush generation in the UK in 1948 marked a turning point in British history, as Caribbean migrants arrived to support post-war labour shortages. However, their children were soon caught in a system of racial discrimination, particularly within education. Many were misdiagnosed as ‘educationally subnormal’ and wrongly placed into ESN schools.</p>
        <p>Bernard Coard’s 1971 pamphlet, <em>How the West Indian Child is Made Educationally Subnormal in the British School System</em>, exposed the systemic bias that labelled Black children as unintelligent. He argued that this misrepresentation was not accidental but structurally embedded in British schooling.</p>
        <p>This injustice is deeply personal to me. My father, a second-generation Windrush descendant, was diagnosed with dyslexia but failed by a system that viewed his differences through a racial lens. My great-grandparents came to Britain for opportunity, but my father's schooling experience tells a different story—one of marginalisation and low expectations.</p>
