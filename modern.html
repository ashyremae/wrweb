  <h2>Continuity in Modern Education</h2>

<p>Although overtly discriminatory practices such as the Educationally Subnormal (ESN) school system have been formally abolished, the structural foundations of racism in British education persist in more covert and bureaucratised forms. What was once explicit segregation has been repackaged through ostensibly neutral policies such as standardised testing, predicted grading, and behavioural management systems. These mechanisms continue to produce unequal outcomes for racially minoritised students. As David Gillborn (2008) asserts, "racism is not an occasional deviation from an otherwise fair system; it is a routine, often invisible, aspect of everyday policy and practice." Racial inequity, therefore, is not incidental but structurally embedded within the education system.</p>

<p>Paul Warmington (2014) similarly critiques the myth of a “post-racial” British education system, arguing that while institutions may claim to be inclusive, they continue to reproduce racial hierarchies. This is supported by Richard Race’s (2005) analysis of Department of Education and Science (DES) circulars from 1965 and 1971, which framed the educational underperformance of West Indian and Asian pupils as rooted in cultural and familial deficits. The 1971 circular, for instance, attributed low achievement to immigrant parents being “shy” or disengaged, thereby locating the problem within minority communities rather than within the institutions themselves. These early policy documents established a framework for pathologising racialised students, reinforcing white-majority norms while marginalising those who did not conform.</p>

<p>Barry Troyna (1987) provides a further critique of the post-war policy trajectory, arguing that the shift from assimilation to multiculturalism failed to address the structural dimensions of racism. Multicultural education (MCE), as implemented in many British schools, focused on superficial aspects of culture, such as food, dress, and festivals, without challenging the systemic inequalities underpinning educational experiences. In contrast, Troyna calls for anti-racist education (ARE), which seeks to confront institutional power and embed equity at the policy, pedagogy, and curriculum level. He and John Williams (1986) refer to superficial approaches as “discrimination by proxy,” whereby symbolic gestures of inclusion ultimately maintain the status quo.</p>

<p>These discriminatory structures were not only ideological but also quantifiable. In 1969, a confidential report by the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) revealed that West Indian children were four times more likely than their white peers to be placed in ESN schools. That same year, 36.9% of ESN pupils were immigrants, compared to just 16.3% in mainstream schools. These disparities demonstrate the extent to which institutional processes misrepresented and marginalised Black children under the guise of support.</p>

<p>Later policy developments reinforced these inequities. Although the Swann Report (1985) acknowledged the existence of institutional racism, its recommendations were swiftly undermined by the 1988 Education Reform Act. This Act introduced a centralised National Curriculum and market-driven reforms that entrenched a narrow, white-centric version of British identity. Stephen Ball (2003) has shown that such marketisation, through parental choice, league tables, and competition, disproportionately disadvantages working-class and racially minoritised students, further entrenching existing inequalities.</p>

<p>These exclusions are compounded when viewed through an intersectional lens. As Heidi Safia Mirza (2009) explains, educational institutions often project an image of “respectability” and inclusion, while covertly enacting policies that marginalise students based on race, class, gender, and disability. Predicted grades and disciplinary procedures continue to reflect unconscious bias, particularly against Black pupils, replicating patterns of inequality first identified by Bernard Coard in the 1970s.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the evidence demonstrates that although the discourse of inclusion has shifted, the material outcomes for Black and racially minoritised students remain consistently unequal. The education system’s apparent neutrality conceals the persistence of colonial logics and institutional racism. Without a deliberate move towards anti-racist frameworks in policy and pedagogy, these structural inequalities will remain intact, reproduced not through overt segregation, but through the normalised procedures of a system still shaped by its racialised past.</p>
