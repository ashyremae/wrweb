  <h1>Digital Activism</h1>
  <p>The question of representation—whose histories are taught, whose identities are affirmed, and whose voices are heard—has been central to debates about racial equity in British education since the post-Windrush era. From the arrival of Caribbean migrants in the late 1940s, Black children have often been rendered invisible within both the curriculum and school structures. Bernard Coard’s 1971 pamphlet, How the West Indian Child Is Made Educationally Subnormal, foregrounded this issue by exposing how the education system not only mislabelled Black children as “subnormal” but also excluded their histories, cultures, and perspectives from formal learning environments. Representation was not simply lacking; it was actively suppressed, reinforcing perceptions of Black inferiority and cultural deficiency. Coard’s critique made clear that this exclusion was not an accidental oversight, but a function of institutional design rooted in colonial power relations.
In contrast, recent decades have witnessed a shift toward more inclusive rhetoric, yet substantive representation remains limited and conditional. The Black Curriculum (2020) argues that while schools may embrace “diversity” in abstract terms, the national curriculum continues to centre white, Eurocentric narratives, relegating Black British history to optional or tokenistic modules.This continuity suggests that the underlying framework of knowledge production remains unchanged. Although multicultural education has become more common since the 1980s, scholars such as Barry Troyna and David Gillborn have critiqued its tendency to celebrate superficial cultural differences (e.g., food, festivals) while avoiding engagement with structural racism and colonial history. Thus, the evolution from overt exclusion to symbolic inclusion reflects a shift in tone, not necessarily in institutional power dynamics.
Primary policy documents reinforce this continuity. The 1971 DES circular, The Education of Immigrants, pathologised West Indian and Asian pupils, framing their cultures as barriers to learning.Fifty years later, Ofsted’s (2021) review reveals that Black pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) continue to face “layered disadvantage” due to racialised assumptions about behaviour and intelligence. Despite policy changes, the representational logic remains consistent: Black children are still framed as problems to be managed rather than full participants in the educational process. Representation, in both past and present contexts, is filtered through dominant discourses that pathologise rather than empower.
However, comparative analysis also reveals sites of resistance and transformation. The Lambeth Good Practice Report (2020) documents localised efforts to embed culturally responsive pedagogy, diversify staffing, and affirm cultural identity, resulting in measurable improvements in engagement and attainment. Similarly, Bowes and Sim’s (2006) research demonstrates that advocacy rooted in lived experience and cultural relevance can counteract institutional neglect, particularly when driven by communities. Yet, as they caution, representation without structural change risks becoming performative or paternalistic—especially when imposed from above without adequate consultation or sustained investment.
In this context, digital advocacy emerges as both a continuation and a transformation of historical resistance. Where Coard distributed printed pamphlets through community networks, today’s activists deploy social media, podcasts, and youth-oriented platforms such as TikTok to educate, mobilise, and reclaim space. This project follows that trajectory, using a website and multimedia content to disseminate Black British history and challenge exclusionary narratives. Digital platforms function as counter-publics that enable historically marginalised voices to produce and circulate knowledge independently of traditional gatekeepers. However, critical evaluation is essential. While these platforms can democratise access, they are also shaped by algorithmic biases, uneven access to technology, and the risk of co-option by superficial diversity branding.
Therefore, representation must be understood as a contested and evolving terrain. Comparative analysis shows that while the forms of exclusion have changed—from overt omission to controlled inclusion—the structural positioning of Black students has not fundamentally shifted. Coard exposed a system that actively misrepresented and marginalised Black children; today's data and activist movements suggest that the same system continues to do so, albeit through more subtle mechanisms. In this sense, efforts like The Black Curriculum and localised digital advocacy do not simply expand representation—they work to transform its meaning, insisting that representation must be linked to justice, empowerment, and structural change.
In conclusion, the struggle for representation in British education is marked by continuity and transformation. From the systemic exclusion of the Windrush generation’s children to the present-day push for a decolonised curriculum and inclusive digital pedagogy, Black communities have consistently challenged their marginalisation. While progress has been made in the language and visibility of inclusion, deeper structural change remains elusive. Representation must move beyond appearance and rhetoric to address the fundamental question of whose knowledge is valued—and to what end. Only through sustained, critical, and community-driven reform can British education begin to fulfil its democratic promise.
