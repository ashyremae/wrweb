    <h2>Modern-Day Reports and Government Data</h2>

<p>Contemporary studies and official reviews demonstrate that racial inequality remains a persistent, institutionalised feature of the British education system. While overtly discriminatory policies have largely disappeared from official documents, their underlying logics—based on racialised assumptions and cultural deficit models—continue to shape the lived experiences of Black students. The Runnymede Trust (2020) reports that “teachers’ low expectations” of Black pupils directly undermine their attainment by influencing not only predicted grades but also how students are disciplined, supported, or streamed. These low expectations are rarely challenged, revealing an implicit racial bias that is normalised within classroom and school cultures. Ofsted (2021) similarly highlights how Black students with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) face “layered disadvantage,” the product of intersecting racial and ableist prejudices. These patterns are not isolated incidents but structural outcomes, echoing the systemic failures identified by Bernard Coard in 1971. Despite a shift in terminology, the mechanisms of misrecognition and educational exclusion he critiqued remain active, though now embedded in data systems, target-driven performance metrics, and behaviour management frameworks.</p>

<p>The Youth Endowment Fund’s (2025) report reinforces this structural analysis with stark statistical data on racial disproportionality across education and criminal justice. Black children, who represent just 6% of the UK’s 10–17-year-old population, make up 24% of youth custody cases—four times their demographic share. They are 64% more likely to be arrested, 84% more likely to be convicted or cautioned, and 150% more likely to be stopped and searched. These disparities persist even when controlling for contextual factors, indicating that racial profiling and institutional risk perceptions, rather than behaviour, are driving disproportionality. Such patterns of over-surveillance and under-protection represent a contemporary extension of the same racial logic that once justified placing Windrush-era children into ESN schools. The YEF findings also illustrate how the education system increasingly feeds the criminal justice system. Black Caribbean children remain disproportionately represented in exclusion figures, and permanent exclusions—often for subjective behavioural “concerns”—are tightly linked to later justice involvement. This “school-to-prison pipeline” serves to criminalise educational failure, reinforcing intergenerational cycles of inequality.</p>

<p>Curricular exclusion functions as another, subtler yet equally damaging mechanism of marginalisation. The Black Curriculum (2020) argues that erasing Black British history from mainstream education contributes to institutional amnesia. This silence not only undermines Black students’ sense of identity and belonging but also sustains ignorance among their peers and teachers, limiting the cultural literacy required to challenge racism. Gloria Ladson-Billings’ theory of the “education debt” is especially illuminating here. She reframes educational inequality not as a gap in achievement but as a debt owed by society for generations of underinvestment, misrepresentation, and exclusion. This framework reveals how seemingly neutral curricular decisions reproduce structural harm, even without overt racial intent. The tokenism of Black History Month or the superficial inclusion of diversity texts cannot address these deep epistemological injustices.</p>

<p>This debt extends into higher education. Bhopal, Myers, and Pitkin (2020) document how many racially minoritised students navigate university spaces with a “specialisation of consciousness”—a heightened, often burdensome awareness of their racialised position. Rather than empowering students, this consciousness often leads to resignation and emotional fatigue. The authors highlight widespread perceptions of institutional hypocrisy: universities publicly champion equality and diversity, yet fail to dismantle exclusionary structures in admissions, assessment, and academic staffing. One student expressed the futility of academic success by stating, “Even though I’m on track for a first, I don’t think it will make much difference compared to a White candidate with a 2:1.” This sentiment reflects a broader mistrust in meritocracy, exposing how racial inequality is embedded in access and how success is recognised, rewarded, and valued.</p>

<p>The employment landscape further validates these concerns. Despite comparable qualifications, Black graduates face higher rates of unemployment, underemployment, and occupational segregation. This undermines the popular narrative that education is a universal equaliser. Instead, it reveals education’s role in maintaining stratified outcomes through the production and legitimation of racialised social capital. Robin DiAngelo’s (2018) concept of “white fragility” helps explain why so little institutional change has followed growing awareness. Many predominantly white institutions engage in symbolic reform—equity statements, awareness weeks, diversity targets—without altering the policies and cultures that produce inequality in the first place. Evaluation of such initiatives often focuses on optics rather than outcomes, allowing systemic inequities to persist behind a progressive façade.</p>

<p>In sum, the challenges facing the descendants of the Windrush generation are not anomalies, but the logical consequence of institutional systems that have evolved in form but not in function. From the disproportionate disciplining of Black students and their exclusion from the curriculum to their overrepresentation in the criminal justice system and marginalisation in higher education and employment, these outcomes reflect a system still shaped by colonial legacies. As Coard warned over fifty years ago, racial inequality in education is neither accidental nor incidental. Today’s statistics are not simply reflective but predictive of future harm. Without sustained, historically literate, and structurally embedded anti-racist reform, educational institutions will continue to replicate the very inequalities they claim to redress.</p>

    <h2>David Lammy, the School-to-Prison Pipeline, and Critical Race Theory</h2>

<p>The relationship between school exclusion and youth criminalisation represents one of the clearest contemporary expressions of structural racism in Britain. The Lammy Review (2017), commissioned by the UK government, identified a direct correlation between exclusion from school and increased contact with the criminal justice system. Lammy noted that a “disproportionate number of BAME children are excluded from school,” and that such exclusion often marks the beginning of a trajectory towards incarceration. This phenomenon, widely referred to as the school-to-prison pipeline, reveals how educational institutions, far from being neutral environments, may function as mechanisms of social stratification and control, disproportionately penalising Black children through exclusionary and punitive practices.</p>

<p>Lammy’s findings strongly align with the principles of Critical Race Theory (CRT), which argues that systemic racism is embedded within the very structures of institutions such as schools, courts, and welfare systems. As Esmorie Miller contends, the British youth justice system operates not in isolation, but in tandem with other state institutions that were historically designed to exclude and disadvantage racialised populations. From this perspective, school exclusions are not simply individual disciplinary decisions, but manifestations of a broader structural logic that systematically denies Black youth access to full citizenship and opportunity.</p>

<p>These insights resonate with Bernard Coard’s seminal 1971 critique, in which he revealed that Black Caribbean children were routinely and disproportionately placed in educationally subnormal (ESN) schools based on biased intelligence testing and teacher perception. A 1969 report by the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) supported Coard’s findings, showing that West Indian children were four times more likely than their white peers to be labelled as subnormal and removed from mainstream education. Although the terminology has changed, the exclusionary processes have not. Today, Black children are disproportionately labelled as “disruptive,” “low attaining,” or “defiant,” and are still routinely pushed out of educational settings rather than supported within them.</p>

<p>Contemporary data from the Youth Endowment Fund (2025) underscores this continuity. Black children constitute only 6% of the UK’s youth population but represent 24% of those in youth custody. They are also 64% more likely to be arrested, 84% more likely to be convicted or cautioned, and 150% more likely to be stopped and searched than their white counterparts. These disparities persist even when controlling for offence severity and socioeconomic factors, highlighting the presence of institutional bias in both education and justice systems. Furthermore, Black Caribbean students remain among the most likely to be excluded from school. As one youth advisor notes, “I had a lot of friends who were excluded and came back, and schools were still targeting them.” These exclusionary cycles reproduce what Miller describes as the “deficit positioning” of Black youth—an institutional tendency to frame their behaviour, culture, and identity as inherently problematic.</p>

<p>Lammy’s personal experience further contextualises these patterns. As the child of Windrush migrants raised in Tottenham, he acknowledges that his academic and professional achievements were shaped by chance opportunities that many of his peers, equally talented, did not receive. His story illustrates that success for Black youth in Britain often depends on exceptionalism, rather than systemic support. His critique is not merely diagnostic but prescriptive: he advocates for early intervention, community-led support services, and diversion from custody, not as optional reforms, but as urgent necessities.</p>

<p>Yet, despite the publication of 35 recommendations in the Lammy Review, institutional uptake has been limited. In a 2021 interview, Lammy lamented the “patchy” implementation of reforms and described the justice system as continuing to “buck the trend” of progress seen in other sectors. Miller’s analysis supports this concern, noting that efforts to address disproportionality often remain superficial. Institutions may adopt diverse language or symbolic representation but fail to disrupt the deeper structures that sustain inequality. The result is a system that appears progressive on the surface, while continuing to exclude, punish, and criminalise Black youth in practice.</p>

<p>Crucially, the failure to respond meaningfully to these critiques reveals the limitations of reformist approaches. The persistence of school exclusions and racial disproportionality in youth justice suggests that the problem is not policy failure but policy design. As Coard argued over five decades ago, the British education system was never created with the full inclusion of Black children in mind. CRT provides the conceptual tools to understand this: exclusion is not a glitch but a function of a system that operates according to racialised assumptions and priorities. The school-to-prison pipeline, therefore, is not an accident—it is the logical outcome of an institutional architecture that continues to value control over care, punishment over prevention, and compliance over inclusion.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the work of Lammy and Miller, supported by historical and contemporary evidence, makes clear that addressing school exclusion and youth criminalisation requires more than policy tweaks. It requires an honest reckoning with the legacy of empire, migration, and institutional racism that continues to shape educational and justice outcomes. These patterns remain alarmingly familiar for the descendants of the Windrush generation, whose early encounters with British schooling were marked by misrecognition and exclusion. Transforming these systems will demand political will and a radical reimagining of education and justice as tools for equity, not exclusion.</p>
