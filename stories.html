   <h2>From ESN Classrooms to Modern Exclusions: Enduring Legacies of Racial Misrecognition in British Education</h2>

<p>Although contemporary educational rhetoric increasingly emphasises inclusion, the systemic misrecognition of Black pupils—particularly those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND)—continues to reflect long-standing structures of racial exclusion rooted in Britain’s post-Windrush schooling system. A pertinent contemporary example is the case of Sam, an 11-year-old Black boy from Hackney who was permanently excluded from school despite formal diagnoses of ADHD and autism. Initially described as a successful student, Sam was removed from mainstream education following an incident triggered by fear and sensory distress—symptoms directly linked to his neurodivergent profile. Rather than receiving appropriate support, Sam was treated as a disciplinary threat, a pattern that legal advocates argue is disturbingly common for Black children with SEND. This misinterpretation of behaviour, when racialised, becomes part of a broader institutional logic in which Black children are disproportionately punished, rather than accommodated.</p>

<p>This dynamic closely mirrors the institutional failures that Bernard Coard identified in his landmark 1971 pamphlet <em>How the West Indian Child Is Made Educationally Subnormal in the British School System</em>. Coard argued that Black Caribbean children were systematically misclassified as intellectually deficient due to cultural and linguistic biases embedded in IQ testing and teacher expectations. Crucially, Coard’s critique was not simply that Black children were misunderstood, but that their educational path was determined by a structure designed to exclude them. He contended that assessments were calibrated to white, middle-class norms, and that schools routinely ignored the cultural capital and intelligence of West Indian pupils. This structural misrecognition—where Blackness itself was read as a deficit—remains evident in cases like Sam’s. Though the terminology has shifted from “subnormal” to “challenging behaviour” or “SEND non-compliance,” the ideological framing is remarkably consistent: Black children who deviate from institutional norms are not supported—they are removed.</p>

<p>This continuity has been substantiated by key scholars in the field. David Gillborn asserts that racism in British education is not an episodic failure but a routine feature of policy, embedded within supposedly neutral mechanisms like testing and discipline. Heidi Safia Mirza further argues that schools sustain narratives of inclusion while systematically marginalising those who do not conform to white, able-bodied expectations—especially Black children with intersecting identities. Through a Critical Race Theory lens, Esmorie Miller shows that Black youth are discursively and institutionally constructed as threats, leading to their overrepresentation in school exclusions and the youth justice system. In this light, Sam’s exclusion is not anomalous; it is the contemporary embodiment of the process that Coard described over five decades ago.</p>

<p>Recent calls for a public inquiry into the historic use of ESN categorisations reaffirm the unresolved nature of this injustice. While educational policy now speaks in the language of inclusion and special needs support, the operational reality often reproduces exclusion through bureaucratic proxies. The racial hierarchies that once justified ESN placements now re-emerge in the disproportionate exclusion of Black children with SEND. As Coard warned, the mislabelling of Black children is not a historical footnote but a persistent structural pattern—one that continues to define educational opportunity through racialised frames of intelligence, behaviour, and belonging.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Sam’s experience is emblematic of the deep-rooted continuities in how the British education system marginalises Black learners. The pathologising logic Coard exposed in the 1970s remains embedded in today’s institutional practices. Unless educational reform addresses the ideological foundations of these exclusions—and not merely their surface manifestations—the injustices faced by the Windrush generation’s children will persist in new, seemingly progressive forms. Sam’s case is not merely reflective of past failures; it is a call to confront how those failures continue to shape the present.</p>
